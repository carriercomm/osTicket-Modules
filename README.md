osTicket-Modules
================
This project develops new modules for the popular osTicket. 

Available Modules
-----------------
<ul>
  <li>Ticket Status - Shapes, Statuses and Colors</li>
</ul>

Installation
------------
Installing the module pack is quick and simple.  Once you have osTicket copied to your server or computer, you can simply overwrite the files that are in this pack.  No built in functionality within osTicket will be lost.

After the files are copied over and osTicket is installed, go to the Admin Panel -> Settings -> Modules.  Here, you can initialize each individual module for use and choose whether they are enabled or disabled for use.

Warning
-------
Please be sure to always make a backup of your web directory and SQL database before implementing ANY changes to your infrastructure.  This is especially true if you are attempting to update an existing system.
